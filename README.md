This is a projecr created to consolidate my learnings in Python for AI.

This scripts create a Linear Model trained on a CSV* with car models, year of release and price, then save the trained model for later use.
Then, in a different scrip, the model is loaded, and a new data is load from another CSV with the model and year, and predicted the prices with the trained model.
Finally, we save the predict values to a new CSV*

Lots of CSV's

*CSV's was created by chat GPT with random values, no data was gethered from real sources.
